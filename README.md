# HackStack

> Software Stack for Hackathons

## Goals

1) High Speed Development

Build a powerful, full-stack product in under one hour -- 60 minutes or less!
This includes RESTful and Websocket API, API documentation in Swagger, and a connected frontend application (see `multi-platform` below).

2) Multi-Platform

Support for integrating frontends written for Web, iOS, or Android to the API server.
SDKs must be provided for each platform and API must be self-documenting in Swagger.
RESTful and Websocket API support must be accessible from all platforms.

3) Performance & Scalability

Once the hack is built, it should not require rebuilding because it was "hacked together".
You should be able to attend a hackathon, build you product fast, and wow the judges.
Once you have their attention, without skipping a beat, go straight into production-mode and scale out to handle your many excited users!
